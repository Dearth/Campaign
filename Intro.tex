\section{Introduction}

Welcome to The Scorched Land campaign setting.  The following chapters will lay 
out the most important aspects of this world, however the DM is encouraged to 
alter the setting to fit their groups play style and goals.  Hopefully this document
will be helpful for those first starting to DM and to those that are veterans
alike.  In the following pages, I will attempt to cover all of back-story, party
motivations, possible quests and important NPCs that the party could encounter on 
their adventure.  Due to the size of the map and openness of the storyline, the 
DM will have to fill in many of the blanks.

\section{Back-story}

A vast ocean encompasses most of the world, and autonomous city-states rule over
what land there is.
