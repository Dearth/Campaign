		\subsubsection{Augustus XVII}
			In the world of Antioc the might of the church and military are 
			placed into the hands one man, the Archbishop--General.  As the 
			current ruler of Antioc, Augustus XVII holds absolute power over
			the affairs of the nation.  Selected by a meeting of the leaders
			of the Knights of the Relic and Knights of Iomedae upon the death 
			of the previous Archbishop, Augustus was chosen to lead the nation
			after being decorated for his services as the commander of the Iron
			Citadel.  Being no stranger to the horrors birthed in Ko' Rau,  
			the new Archbishop--General has decided to throw the full might of 
			Antioc against the evil continent.  After three years with no 
			marked improvement, the Archbishop--General has made a plea for 
			help to all the surrounding nations.

		\subsubsection{Andor, The Man in Red}

		Once a Red Wizard, Andor has been banished from the Iron Citadel
		for speaking out against the yearly rituals and now lives atop
		a mountain on Haunya.  The local goblin tribe have adopted his
		Iron Band tattoo as their new crest and revere him as a wise 
		and powerful man.  Since the goblins live close to a mountain
		pass used frequently by the Thieves Guild as a smuggling route,
		they now raid carrivans, hoping to catch a group transporting
		some of the relics necessary for the Fires of Dis ritual.  He
		can grant the party information or even a boon depending on how
		much he likes the party.  A percentile or diplomacy 
		check to decide.
