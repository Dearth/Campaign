		\subsubsection{N'Gulonga}

		A port city on the northern coast of Haunya, N'Gulonga has grown 
		in importance since the Northern Fires started.  With its proximity
		to Ko' Rau, the city has become a popular destination for adventurers
		on expeditions into the Burning North.  The port bustles with all
		manner of travelers, merchants and adventurers, some heading into 
		the northern continent, others carrying goods to the Temple of 
		Iomedae.  Even though the Knights of the Relic rule over the city,
		trade on the black market continues to grow.  In recent years, the 
		unsavory trade of undead, devils, and demons developed into a major 
		business.
