			In the middle of the Great Plains of Haunya, sleeps one of the
			worlds largest deserts. At least a weeks travel from end to end,
			few people who venture into the desert unprepared reach their
			destination.  Resourceful nomads, roaming djinn and a few other
			tribes call the Sands home.  Most of the tribes know how difficult
			travel through the desert can be and treat all they meet with
			unending hospitality, though others will defend their ancient
			homeland to the death.  A perpetual sandstorm whirls around the
			center of the desert, guarding sunken city, Ubar or Iram of the
			Pillars.  The legendary City of Brass, home to the djinn and
			efreeti, contains wonders and artifacts few have laid eyes upon
			in the past few century.
