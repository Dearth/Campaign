		\subsubsection{Andor, The Man in Red}

		Once a Red Wizard, Andor has been banished from the Iron Citadel
		for speaking out against the yearly rituals and now lives atop
		a mountain on Haunya.  The local goblin tribe have adopted his
		Iron Band tattoo as their new crest and revere him as a wise 
		and powerful man.  Since the goblins live close to a mountain
		pass used frequently by the Thieves Guild as a smuggling route,
		they now raid carrivans, hoping to catch a group transporting
		some of the relics necessary for the Fires of Dis ritual.  He
		can grant the party information or even a boon depending on how
		he likes or gets a long with them.  A percentile or diplomacy 
		check to decide.
