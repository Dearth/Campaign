The character sheet template uses python scripts inside of a latex document 
to output a Pathfinder Character Sheet.  

STATUS:

The project is currently in pieces, I am in the middle of transitioning it from
sagetex, which not everyone has and is a pain to get running, to just python.  
Hopefully this move will allow for more usablity.  

If you do not fear the sagetex, feel free to grab the src file from the already completed druid
character sheet.
